## Current Projects and Achievements

### Fine-Tuning BERT Models on Custom Data
I have fine-tuned popular NLP models such as BERT on custom datasets, applying advanced techniques to optimize their performance for domain-specific tasks. I have also written blog on fine-tuning on LLMs. Will publish it shortly.

## Completing and uploading this week: 

### Fine-Tuning Open-Source Models
I have successfully fine-tuned open-source models like LLAMA, Mistral, and Zephyr for various use cases. Using Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and QLoRA, I achieved powerful results with reduced computational requirements. The models and results will be uploaded later this week.

### Instruction Fine-Tuning for OpenAI Models
I have fine-tuned OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 models, integrating APIs to customize the models for specific domains and tasks. These optimized models and insights will be available shortly.

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Optimization Methods
I explored RLHF to improve language model performance, implementing advanced optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). These efforts have resulted in enhanced model quality, and the findings will be shared soon.
